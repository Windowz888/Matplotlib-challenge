# Matplotlib-challenge
The young pharmaceutical business Pymaceuticals Inc. has just launched an animal research to explore new treatments for disease. Over the course of 45 days, tumour growth in 249 mice bearing SCCs was assessed and monitored while they were treated with various medication regimens. Pymaceuticals' most promising medication candidate, Capomulin, is the primary target of our analysis. Data cleansing, generation of summary statistics, visualisation in the form of bar charts and pie charts, calculation of quartiles, identification of outliers, and generation of a box plot are all part of the project's scope. For one of the Capomulin-treated animals, we also generate a line plot and a scatter plot depicting the growth of the tumour volume over time and the correlation between mouse weight and the mean observed tumour volume, respectively. Finally, we develop a linear regression model and compute the correlation coefficient to better comprehend the connection between mouse weight and median detected tumour volume. The results of this study are crucial because they not only provide information on the efficacy of the various treatment plans, but also lay the groundwork for future investigations and clinical trials.
